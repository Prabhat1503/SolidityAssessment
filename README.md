Project Title


Creating a contract named token.



Description


The contract must have:


1- a public variables that store the details about the coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply),


2- a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)


3- a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the
address by that amount,


4- a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and the address's balance,


5- and lastly, the burn function should have conditionals to ensure the account balance is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.
